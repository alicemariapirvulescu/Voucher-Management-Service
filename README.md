# Voucher-Management-Service
The Voucher Management Service is an application that gives users the opportunity to access different types of vouchers from different campaigns that they can use for a limited period of time. 
Users get notifications for any change related to the campaigns.
For this project I applied the OOP principles to create a practical system for any online shop that wants to give out sales or vouchers.
